## Version Control Protocol

### Version Numbering (Semantic)
- **Major (X.0.0)**: Structural changes, new major features
- **Minor (0.X.0)**: New sections, significant content
- **Patch (0.0.X)**: Corrections, clarifications

### Update Triggers
- **Design Change**: Update GAME_DESIGN → cascade to GAMEPLAY_SYSTEMS
- **Technical Discovery**: Update SDK_PATTERNS → notify TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE
- **Sprint Complete**: Update IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP → review all docs

---

## Cross-Reference Matrix

| From Document | References | Dependency Level |
|--------------|------------|------------------|
| GAME_DESIGN | → GAMEPLAY_SYSTEMS | High |
| GAMEPLAY_SYSTEMS | → TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE | High |
| TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE | → SDK_PATTERNS_REFERENCE | Critical |
| IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP | → All Documents | Medium |
| SDK_PATTERNS_REFERENCE | → None (Reference) | None |

## Maintenance Schedule

### Daily
- Check for ad-hoc notes needing consolidation
- Update IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP task status

### Weekly (Friday)
- Review all document change logs
- Update version numbers
- Archive deprecated sections
- Team sync on documentation changes

### Monthly
- Full document review
- Consolidate duplicates
- Update cross-references
- Assess restructuring needs

---

## Quality Checks

### Red Flags
1. ❌ Information in 3+ places → Consolidate immediately
2. ❌ Section > 500 lines → Split into subsections
3. ❌ Document unchanged 30+ days → Review relevance
4. ❌ Broken cross-references → Fix within 24 hours
5. ❌ Version mismatch → Reconcile dependencies

### Green Flags
1. ✅ All documents updated within cycle
2. ✅ No duplicate information
3. ✅ Clear ownership and accountability
4. ✅ Version numbers synchronized
5. ✅ Team can find info in < 30 seconds

## Critical Documentation Gaps (2025-09-29)

### Missing from Current Documentation
Based on consistency review, the following major implementations from 2025 are not documented:

#### Visual Systems (January-September 2025)
- **High-Resolution Sphere System**: Custom mesh generation, LOD system, verification tools
- **Quantum Grid Shader**: URP shader with grid lines and quantum state markers
- **WebGL Optimizations**: Scale corrections, async loading, debug overlays

#### System Architecture Updates
- **GameEventBus State Machine**: Complete event-driven architecture with state validation
- **Player Control System**: Minecraft-style third-person controls (December 2024)
- **Position Persistence**: Player save/restore system across sessions
- **Build Pipeline**: Automated Unity builds for multiple environments

#### Recent Implementations Not Documented
- **Orb Visualization System**: Event-driven orb spawning (September 2025)
- **Debug System**: SystemDebug with 12 categories (September 2025)
- **Deployment Scripts**: Unified PowerShell/Bash deployment system
- **Editor Tools**: World setup, mesh generation, prefab management

### Documentation Conflicts to Resolve
1. **Mining System**: Design docs describe "quantum circuit minigames" vs actual "frequency matching"
2. **World Organization**: "Shell system" in design vs single spherical worlds in implementation
3. **Feature Status**: Many "planned" features are actually implemented

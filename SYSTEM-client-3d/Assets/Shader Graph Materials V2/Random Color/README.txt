This shader uses the position of the object as a seed of a random function, and the other to unwrap a noise texture,
 both then uses that random value to get a color from a gradient, this effect is great for creating some variant on how green foliage is colored.

Properties:
- **Seed**: Defines the randomness of the noise pattern.
- **Noise Scale**: Adjusts the size and detail level of the noise texture.

Tips:
- Combine with color gradients for vibrant, abstract effects.
- Animate the **Seed** property over time for dynamic, evolving patterns.
- Use a high Noise Scale for subtle textures or a low scale for bold, blocky effects.

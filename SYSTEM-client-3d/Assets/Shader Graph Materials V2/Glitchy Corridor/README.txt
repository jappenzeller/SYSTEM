The Glitchy Shader generates a dynamic and chaotic glitch effect, perfect for sci-fi, digital distortion, or artistic applications. 
It combines vibrant emission, surface detailing, and glitch-specific parameters for maximum impact.

Properties:
- **Albedo Texture**: Base color texture for the material.
- **Base Color**: Sets the overall color tint.
- **Normal Texture**: Adds detailed surface features using a normal map.
- **Normal Strength**: Adjusts the intensity of the normal map (0 to 1).
- **Ambient Occlusion (AO) Texture**: Enhances shadow details in crevices.
- **Tiling**: Controls the repetition of textures across the surface.
- **Smoothness**: Defines the glossiness of the material (0 to 1).
- **Metallic**: Adjusts the metallic appearance (0 to 1).
- **Start Fading At**: Sets the distance from the camera where fading begins.
- **Fade Range**: Determines the extent of the fade effect.
- **Glitch Speed**: Controls the speed of glitch distortions.
- **Glitch Probability**: Adjusts the likelihood of glitches occurring (0 to 1).
- **Emission Color**: Adds glowing effects to the material.
- **Rotation Speed**: Controls how fast the glitches rotate or shift.
- **Distortion Amount**: Defines the intensity of the glitch distortion.

Tips:
- Use **Glitch Probability** creatively for sporadic or constant glitches.
- Combine **Emission** with vibrant colors for a glowing, cyberpunk feel.
- Experiment with fading and distortion for unique, layered effects.

This shader uses the camera position to skew the mesh based on the camera direction with some randomness,
 this corridor has no lights it is all baked, feel free to use it/modify if you want.

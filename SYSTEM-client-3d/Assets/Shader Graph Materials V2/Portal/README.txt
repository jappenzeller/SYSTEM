The Portal Shader creates a mesmerizing portal effect with animated distortion. 

Properties:
- **Texture Speed**: Controls the animation speed of the noise texture (0 to 1).
- **Texture Scale**: Adjusts the size of the noise texture pattern.
- **Distortion**: Defines the intensity of the distortion effect (0 to 1).

This shader is very similar to the Glass shader, the difference is that it has a noise texture distorting the scene color node.

Note: Built-in pipeline doesn't support scene color node so a normal shader is attached instead of a graph.
